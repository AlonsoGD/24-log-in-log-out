## LOG IN LOG OUT

This application is meant to log timestamps in a googlesheet.
You can log in a entry timestamp and an exit timestamp. The app will show the elapsed time between both timestamps.

A google account is needed to log in and start saving records.

Currently, it just saves the records in a [googlesheet located in my Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D83m9_MC_9I-Ji2wPDgm0VCpoz4IzPNfIVVnMY5Atqk/edit?usp=sharing) but my plan is to be able to store and create a new speadsheet for different every user.
